Some of my achievements on my current work include\n            performing key changes in the products I am responsible of,\n            improving their interpretation and the acceptation of the clients. I\n            have represented the company national and internationally, both in\n            trainings to the sales reps and participating in congresses. Thanks\n            to my previous experience in the research field, I have been\n            involved in research projects of the company, including the phases\n            of design, analysis and interpretation of results. I am familiarized\n            with management activities and I am capable of working on several\n            related and unrelated tasks contemporaneously. I also created my own\n            company, with the aim to perform genetic analyses on different\n            diseases for research investigators and to perform trainings on the\n            genetic field.\n          </p>\n        </Content>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Index;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAoBA;AACA;AACA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
